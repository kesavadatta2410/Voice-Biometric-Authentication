1. What does L2 Normalization actually do?
Imagine a vector as an arrow pointing from the center of a graph. Some arrows might be very long (high magnitude), and some might be very short.

L2 Normalization takes all these arrows and stretches or shrinks them so they all have a length of exactly 1.

2. Why use it here? (3 Key Reasons)
A. Making "Cosine Similarity" easy
In speaker verification, we compare two voices by looking at the angle between their vectors, not the length.

If the vectors are normalized to length 1, calculating the Dot Product between them is mathematically identical to calculating the Cosine Similarity.

This makes the math much faster and more stable during training.

B. The "Unit Hypersphere"
By forcing every embedding to have a length of 1, you are essentially placing every speaker's "fingerprint" on the surface of a giant ball (a Unit Hypersphere).

Now, the model only has to care about where on the ball the speaker is, rather than how far they are from the center.

C. Stability (Preventing "Exploding" Values)
Without normalization, a very loud audio clip might produce huge numbers in the vector, while a quiet clip might produce tiny numbers. This "loudness" has nothing to do with the speaker's identity. L2 Normalization removes the effect of "loudness/magnitude" and focuses only on the "identity/direction."

🔹 What Contrastive Loss does

For each pair (emb1, emb2, label):

Positive pair (label = 1)
→ distance should be small

Negative pair (label = 0)
→ distance should be large (≥ margin)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


🔹 Mathematical intuition (simple)

Let:
D = distance between embeddings
y = label (1 = same, 0 = different)
m = margin
Loss:
L = y * D²  +  (1 − y) * max(0, m − D)²
Interpretation:
Same speaker → penalize large distance
Different speakers → penalize distance < margin
📌 This directly shapes the embedding space.

max times frames is 342 so taking 400 as max time frames and padding rest with zeros
